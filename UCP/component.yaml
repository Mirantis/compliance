          Docker Content Trust is a capability provided by CS Docker Engine that

          These signatures allow client-side verification of the integrity and
          publisher of specific image tags. All Universal Control Plane Docker
          images are officially signed and verified by Docker, Inc.

          When installing Universal Control Plane, you should enable Docker
          Content Trust (per the instructions at

          Universal Control Plane contains two, built-in root certificate
          authorities. One CA is used for signing client bundles generated by
          users. The other CA is used for TLS communication between UCP cluster
          nodes. Should you choose to use certificates signed by an external CA,
          in order to successfully authenticate in to the system, those
          certificates must include a root CA public certificate, a service
          certificate and any intermediate CA public certificates (in addition
          to SANs for all addresses used to reach the UCP controller), and a
          private key for the server.

          Access to a Universal Control Plane cluster is only granted when a

          When a client bundle has been generated or an existing public key has

          Docker Content Trust gives you the ability to verify both the
          integrity and the publisher of all the data received from a Docker
          Trusted Registry over any channel. It allows operations with a remote
          DTR instance to enforce client-side signing and verification of image
          tags. It provides for the ability to use digital signatures for data
          sent to and receive from remote DTR instances. These signatures allow
          client-side verification of the integrity and publisher of specific
          image tags. Universal Control Plane can be configured to only run
          trusted and signed images. Instructions for configuring this can be
