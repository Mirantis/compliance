    'Docker Datacenter (DDC) is an integrated solution for developers and IT
    operations to collaborate as part of the enterprise software supply chain.
    It is an enterprise-grade secure container orchestration and application
    management platform built and maintained by Docker, Inc. DDC is made up of
    three core components: Commercially Supported Docker Engine, Docker Trusted
    Registry and Universal Control Plane.
    
    For each control origination, the cloud service provider (CSP) is in context
    to you, the DDC consumer. The customer in this context is any entity outside
    your organization using your services. Definitions for each of the control
    originations referenced by the components are as follows:

    - Service Provider Corporate: A control that orignizations from the service
    provider corporate network
    - Service Provider System Specific: A control specific to a particular
    system at the service provider and the control is not part of the standard
    corporate controls
    - Service Provider Hybrid: A control that makes use of both corporate
    controls and additional controls specific to a particular system at the
    service provider
    - Configured by Customer: A control where the customer needs to apply a
    configuration in order to meet the control requirement
    - Provided by Customer: A contriol where the customer needs to provide
    additional hardware or software in order to meet the control requirement
    - Shared: A control that is managed and implemented partially by the
    service provider and partially by the customer'
