The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Kubernetes Benchmark is a reference
document that can be used by system administrators, security and audit
professionals and other IT roles to establish a secure configuration baseline
for Kubernetes. CIS Benchmarks are developed by an open community of security
practitioners and licensed under a [Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 Internal Public
License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode).

The latest benchmark for Kubernetes 1.8 (CIS Benchmark v1.2.0) can be found
[here](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/). This benchmark can be
used to harden the Kubernetes components that are made available as part of the
upcoming release of Docker Enterprise Edition (18.01).

Below is a list of tools and resources that can be used to automate the
validation of an instance of Kubernetes against the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark:
